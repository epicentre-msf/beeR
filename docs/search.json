Perhaps you love snacks and helping your colleagues work through bugs in their code?\nIt seems like there is not on only a lot of interest in R but also a lot of folks already doing interesting things. Unfortunately, there doesn’t seem to be a platform in place to share our knowledge, ask questions, and discuss new projects. UNTIL NOW!\nWe are setting up an informal event, beeR, that will take place twice a month and give us an opportunity to learn R together. The sessions will have a short (15-30 minute) tutorial and will rotate between beginner and advanced subjects.\nWe don’t want to add another formal meeting to anyone’s (already busy) agenda. That’s why we are organizing something casual with sessions alternating between 18h00 and 13h00. These sessions are meant to be as much social as educational, so come curious and bring snacks!\n(ps. R is a free, open source, programming language for statistical analysis, dashboards, and SO. MUCH. MORE.)"

    "text": "Like any other programming language R can be challenging, and it is VERY common for any R users to get stuck and requiring some help.\n\nDid you forget a function name ? Or maybe you forgot what a function does and what arguments it takes ?\nYou are wondering if there is already an existing package doing what you are trying to do with your data ?\nYou are completely confused about how to filter this dataframe ?\nYou want to know if someone else struggled a very specific thing with your favorite package ?\nYou need someone to explain you how the pivot_longer() and pivot_wider() functions work ?\nYou finished your summer book and you are looking for something thrilling to read before bed ?\n\nThe mighty Internet is full of various resources to help you, and R has a great community of users that happily help each other !\n\n\nFirst let’s start with the beginning, you can access informations about functions using the ?help function. Just type a ? before an empty function to get this function documentation in the Helper pane (if using Rstudio).\n?filter()\nThis will give you information about the filter() function:\n\nwhat this function does\nThe arguments it takes\nThe value it outputs\nUse case examples\n\nNearly every functions in R have documentations, and these are accessible offline ! It is the starting point to look for answers !\n\n\n\n?help function and documentation is useful if you actually know the name of the function. This is not always the case, or you may want to look into a package see if there are other useful functions for you. In this case it is useful to have a look at the package vignette (if the package has one). They are long-form guide, that describe the target problems that a package is trying to adress.\nbrowseVignettes()\nto access all vignettes for packages installed on your R. Otherwise type\nvignette(\"colwise\", package = \"dplyr\")\nto access specific vignette inside a package.\nWith recent packages, vignettes are also combined into a package website, which provides all informations and further resources regarding the package. See this example of the gtsummary package\nhttps://www.danieldsjoberg.com/gtsummary/index.html\n\n\n\nFor advance cases where you want to know if a package/function does a very specific thing, or if you want more information on the back-end of the functions you could directly check the code on the GitHub repository for the package. This is where all the code/files and revision history is stored. Because R is an open source language, this is open to anyone to inspect, or even copy. This is an example of a GitHub repository:\nhttps://github.com/R4EPI/epikit\nIf you have the skills (and authors agree), you can contribute to a package, or copy them to add your own tweaks to them. Also, this is where you can find the associated GitHub issues, points/problems/suggestions that people have mentionned to the package authors.\n\n\n\nKeep in mind that few people program everyday completely offline. Most of us are frequently browsing internet for solutions, or because we forgot how to do some things. If you get stuck on a problem, a quick browser search should be your next step after checking functions and package documentation.\nAt the start of your R learning quest, most of your problems have already been encountered by other users. You will improve your programming skills when you will be able to efficiently search for solutions online.\nWhen doing an internet search you need key words Always mention R programming language to force searches on it and exclude python or other languages. The more generic is the question, and the less likely you will rapidly find an answer. If you are using tidyverse / dplyr or specific functions to solve a problem then you need to mention them in your search. Be as specific as possible !\n\n\n\nYou will find most of your answers on Q&A forums. You can read discussion threads if your problem was already adressed, or you can write a question yourself. Just bear in mind that this require reproducible examples (to be covered in a future BeeR session).\n\n\n\nhttps://stackoverflow.com/\n\nEvery programmer has a tab open to Stack Overflow ! This is the bible for programming questions and discussions. You will find most of your issues here. To make sure that your browser search sends you to appropriate Stack Overflow discussions make sure you mention R programming. many programming languages use similar terminologies.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://community.appliedepi.org/\n\nThe Applied Epi NGO has a nice Q&A forum on which you can find all sort of discussion specifically on R for Epidemiology.\n\n\n\n\nhttps://community.rstudio.com/\n\nPosit (ex R-studio) also provides a Q&A forum called the Posit community. You can find a lot of useful discussions specific to R, but also Posit IDE (R-studio).\nCheck also the Posit Cloud guides. Nice, small introductionary exercises to R."
